When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatcally stay up-to-date with your remote?
To avoid distributing code that needs testing or failed testing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clones are pure copies of a repository, forks are github
repositories that point back to the original, branches are like commits which pass
on there name after they are commited. Forks for messing
with other peoples stuff, clones for just makeing a copy,
branched for messing with your own stuff. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can acess it off-line.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We would have to send files over the internet. Possibly we could store them on some other service. It 
would be harder without version control and the merge feature.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You would make changes in a seperate banch to make sure the master branch is always functional, exept shoretly
after failed merges. Changeing master direc;y could save some time.
