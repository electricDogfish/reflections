What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creats a dirrectory called .git to store metadata about the directory it is in. You need to run init so you can start making commits to track your files!


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging are is the list of files you are working on, and are the ones that are added in a commit. It gives you more control. You like control, thats why you are a cs major.
